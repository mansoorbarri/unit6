Whether it's the daily commute or a weekend off-road adventure, the Aim Allroad has got you covered. With a full complement of mudguards, luggage rack, lighting system and kickstand, you're all set for tackling the mean city streets in style and comfort.

Come the weekend, grippy 2.25in tyres, a 100mm Suntour suspension fork and Shimano's wide-ranging 2x8 gears give you the tools you need to explore where your curiosity takes you. And, wherever you are, the powerful disc brakes ensure you're always in full control, whatever the weather throws at you.

Completely revised for 2022, the brand-new Aim Allroad redefines versatility. With its included full-length mudguards, luggage carrier and lighting system, it has everything you need right out of the box. There's a threaded bottom bracket and internal cable routing for long-lasting service and simple maintenance, and the flat disc mount integrates seamlessly with the included kickstand. Updated geometry includes a lower top tube for more confident handling, and there's plenty of room to run wide, grippy and comfortable 2.25in tyres. The Cube SizeSplit system has an expanded range too, so however tall you are there'll be an Aim Allroad that fits perfectly.
