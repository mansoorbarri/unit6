**For some, a bike is more than just a bike, it is a reflection of ones self.**

The Hartington is a functional yet fashionable bike that offers style and sophistication with a splash of fun. With its classic styling and modern geometry, its a bike that doesnt only just look good but also rides as good as many other bikes in other sectors.

## Features:
* Hydro formed alloy frame. Driven by Shimano 21 speed drive train and rolling on 32h alloy wheels and deli tyres. Stopped by powerful Tektro V brakes. Finished with a forme alloy cockpit.
* Light weight 6061 alloy frame - keeping the weight low was the key factor when designing the hartington for no compromise performance.
* Comfort saddle and grips -contact points are the first thing you notice when you sit on a bike. For this reason, we spec ergonomic, comfortable saddles and grips.
* Ergonomic handlebars-swept handlebars help achieve a more natural and relaxed riding position.
Full length chainguard - full-length chainguard helps protect any excess clothing from drivetrain oil.
