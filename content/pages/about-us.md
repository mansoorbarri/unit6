At Spoke & Hub, we are more than just your average cycle shop. We are two brothers, Jake and Ethan, bound by a shared love for cycling and driven by a passion for the open road. With distinct cycling interests, one of us thrives on triathlons, while the other embraces the thrill of road races. Together, we have created a haven for all cycling enthusiasts, a place where our combined knowledge, experience, and love for the sport come together to serve your every cycling need.

## Our Journey

Our cycling journey started as kids, pedaling around the neighborhood on hand-me-down bikes. As we grew older, our love for cycling evolved. Jake became enthralled by the art of triathlons, relishing the challenges of swimming, biking, and running in seamless harmony. Meanwhile, Ethan's heart raced for the exhilarating speed and strategy of road races. This diverse spectrum of cycling experiences has provided us with a wealth of knowledge, skills, and insights that we are excited to share with our fellow cyclists.
